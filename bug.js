In React Native, when working with FlatList or SectionList, a common yet subtle error arises when the `keyExtractor` prop isn't properly implemented or is missing entirely.  The `keyExtractor` function is crucial for uniquely identifying each item in the list.  Without it, React Native struggles to efficiently update the list, resulting in unpredictable behavior such as incorrect rendering, slow performance, and even crashes.  Specifically, if you're using a complex data structure or the `key` property isn't consistent or reliable, you'll likely encounter this issue. For example, if using objects with changing keys, relying on the object reference itself will result in unexpected rendering.  Incorrect implementation could result in unnecessary re-renders, performance degradation, or even UI glitches. The issue often manifests as visual anomaliesâ€”some items not appearing or displaying incorrectly, or items flickering or disappearing.
